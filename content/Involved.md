# Do you love ecology? 

**If you are interested in learning more about ecology, consider one of the ways below to get more involved!**

---

### 1) Join an ecological association
There are a lot of ecologists out there and the field of ecology is incredibly broad. Consider joining an ecological association to meet others who share your love of ecology. Each of these associations hold an annual meeting, which is a great way to meet potential graduate school advisers, learn about internship opportunities, or find ecology-related jobs.

While there are a plethora of ecological societies, below are a sampling of some of the more broad ones:

* [The Ecological Society of America](https://www.esa.org/)
*ESA provides a listserv service to members and it often posts jobs, internships, and graduate school opportunities!* Note, there is also a [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/), a [Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution](https://csee-scee.ca/), and an [International Association for Ecology](http://intecol.org/), etc. etc.

* [The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation](https://tropicalbiology.org/)

* [Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences](https://aessonline.org/)

* See the [Yale University Library](https://guides.library.yale.edu/c.php?g=295999&p=1973305) for a more complete listing


### 2) Conduct ecological research
In my opinion, one of the most exciting parts of being an ecologists is conducting research. It's pretty cool to study and conclude something that potentially no one else has yet discovered! It's also a great way to find out where your interests really lie. 

Since ecology is a broad field, the types of ecological research you can do will vary wildly. For example, for those with a computer science background might consider research involving computer modeling (e.g. agent-based modeling, population dynamics, etc). Those with interests in Earth Science may enjoy research looking at abiotic factors of an ecosystem, while those with interests in social sciences might think about researching the human component of a system or urban ecology projects. Essentially, there something for everyone when it comes to ecology so if you're interested in conducting research, let's talk!


### 3) Apply for an ecology internship
Do you think you might want to work in an ecology-related field? A great way to answer that question is to apply for an internship. Internships provide you with valuable hands-on experience for conducting ecological work. Depending on your research interests, there are a variety of ecological internships available. Check out larger institutes like the [NASA DEVELOPMENT Program](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/apply.php), NGOs such as [The Wildlife Society](https://wildlife.org/tag/internships/), state-level programs including the [South Carolina Department of Natural Resources](http://www.southcarolinawild.org/2018/10/01/2019-scdnr-internships-wff/), or the [Ecological Society of America listserv](http://community.esa.org/group.htm?mode=home&igid=35455) for starters.


### 4) Explore the ecological literature
There is a wealth of ecological research that has been done and more ecology papers are being published daily. Why not read a few to see what piques your interest? Here are some great starting resources:

* [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/)*

* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/)*

* [Ecological Society of America Journals](https://www.esa.org/publications/)*

* [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/earth_climate/environmental_science/)**


<sup>*These do require subscription access, but you should be able to access them through your University Library. </sup>

<sup> **Note these are essentially press releases. Be sure to check the citation at the bottom of the page for the actual publication. </sup>
