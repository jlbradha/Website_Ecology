## Course Overview
Welcome to Terrestrial Ecology! I am THRILLED to teach this class and I hope to show you why terrestrial ecology is such a fascinating field. We will begin the course by exploring some basic ecological principles and theories. Once we have a firm foundation of ecological knowledge, we will explore pressing ecological issues and current proposals to address those issues. Using field and computational techniques, we will collect and evaluate data to better understand our local ecosystems. Be prepared for lots of outside time, 

## Course Objectives
After taking this course, students should be able to:

* Understand principles and theories describing terrestrial biotic and abiotic factors in the environment

* Analyze interactions between organisms in the environment and model how changes in interactions will infuence the future of an ecosystem

* Formulate ecological hypotheses, design and implement simple field research methods,
and analyse field data using appropriate statistical techniques

* Recognize the value of various ecosystem states to human society

* Collect, analyze, and interpret ecological data using the R computing language

* Clearly communicate scientific findings orally and in writing




#### A note on labs
I have arrranged this course such that approximately half the labs are fieldwork based and the other half are analytical. Field-based labs will occur outside (most often at Glendale). For these labs, please be sure to dress appropriately and bring necessary supplies. This includes (but is not limited to):

* hiking boots or outdoor walking shoes (no flip-flops!)

* Outdoor, weather-apropriate clothing

* water

* sunscreen

* snacks (granola bar, etc...not a 4-course meal)

Analytical labs will occur within the computer classroom, room ### in the xxx building ([campus map](https://www.wofford.edu/Wofford.edu/Documents/About/campusMapApril19.pdf)). While I will make every effort to remind you in class of where lab will be held that week, the [schedule](content/schedule) will always be up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include one of the following: ENVS 202, BIO 150, CHEM 104, or COSC 101

*If you do not have one of these prerequites, please come see me! I am happy to make exceptions, when appropriate, for students with non-scientific backgrounds*.  

## Grading

The grade breakdown for the course is as follows:

|                       |       |      |
|:---------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class Participation & Homework    | 20%   |      |
| Lab Exercises                     | 20%   |      |
| Exams                             | 20%   |      |
| Final Project                     | 20%   |      |
| Final Exam                        | 20%   |      |


****Late assignments** will be penalized 10% for each day they are late, up to five days. After 5 days, the assignment penalty will remain at 50%.



## Textbook 

Miller, G. T., and S. Spoolman. 2015. [Essentials of Ecology](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Ecology-G-Tyler-Miller/dp/1337100099/ref=dp_ob_image_bk). 8<sup>th</sup> edition. Cengage Learning, Stanford, CT, USA. 

<sub> *A free copy of the 5th edition can be found [here](https://sangu.ge/images/EssentialsofEcology.pdf) and will contain the same basic principles we cover but will not have the most up to date information on current issues.* </sub>

**Do the readings before class**. As this material will formulate the foundation for in-class discussions, it is imperitive that you complete all reading assignments *prior to class*. For details on reading assignments, please see the [course schedule](../content/Schedule.md).

## Attendance

Because I am so excited about ecology, I have planned a jam-packed semester and will use every second of class time available. Therefore, if you are late to class, you will miss valuable information! Please make every effort to arrive to class on time and prepared. Excessive tardies will negatively affect your participation grade. 

Attendance is required at every class. There are no make-up assignments for missing class or lab. However, you are still responsible for knowing the material come exam time. However, emergencies do arise and related abseneces will be excused with written, verifiable documentation provided for legitimate emergencies (e.g. representing Wofford in an official capacity, family emergency, accident, etc). In these circumstances, please let me know as early as possible that you will be missing class.



## Academic Honesty

The Honor Code is an important institution at Wofford College. Everyone is expected to follow both the letter and the spirit of the code and students violating this code will be reported to the university’s honor council. Examples of code violations include but are not limited to: cheating on exams, plagiarism, failure to report known violations, and falsification of class records. Further, not knowing how to reference a source is not an excuse. That means that wording, paraphrasing, or word for word copying without giving the original source credit are all violations. Anything you submit should reflect your own ideas with proper citations for any material you got from other sources—be it a book, a person, or a webpage. 

Last, I will be explicit throughout the year in letting you know what assignments are to be done individually and which assignments are collaborative. If at any time you have questions regarding citations or are unclear whether the assignment is to be done individually, please ask. 

More information on the Wofford College Honor Code can be found [here](https://www.wofford.edu/Wofford.edu/Documents/development/Honor%20Code_RightsResp.pdf).


## Accomodations

Every student learns differently and when possible, I am happy to work with students to meet their individual needs. Please see me or email me if you require special accommodations due to documented learning disabilities, physical requirements, medical needs, or any other reasons. I want every student to be successful in this course and am happy to make accommodations when appropriate. Below are some important resources you may find useful:
