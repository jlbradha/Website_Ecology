# Software Resources

While all analytical work can be done in the computer lab, you may find you prefer to also work from your own computer. Here are some helpful resources for installing the appropriate software on your computer. Please come to me if you need additional help. 


### R 
We will be using the R language throughout this course. As per the description on the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html): 

>*R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [...] R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible [...] One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.*

You can download R for free at https://cran.rstudio.com/
* Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
* Mac OS X: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/


### RStudio
To facilitate easy interfacing with R, we will use the RStudio IDE. You can learn more about RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/) *hint - it does so much more than what we will get to in class! This entire website and all the course materials were created through RStudio!*

You can download the free RStudio desktop version at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
